Thanks for the clarification ‚Äî since you're **not using SQLite** and you're using **MySQL**, but Laravel is still throwing this error:

> `Database file at path [doctordesk] does not exist...`

It means **Laravel is still trying to use SQLite**, even though you've configured MySQL in `.env`.

---

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Fix

#### ==1. **Ensure `.env` is configured properly**==

==Make sure these lines are in your `.env` file:==

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=doctordesk
DB_USERNAME=root       # or your actual DB username
DB_PASSWORD=           # or your actual DB password
```


#### ==2. **Clear config cache**==

==Laravel might still be using a cached config pointing to SQLite.==

==Run the following commands:==

```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:cache
```

---

#### ==3. **Check `config/database.php`**==

==Ensure this file is using the `.env` variables correctly. Look for the `'default'` and `'mysql'` sections.==

==**Example:**==

```php
'default' => env('DB_CONNECTION', 'mysql'),

'mysql' => [
    'driver' => 'mysql',
    'host' => env('DB_HOST', '127.0.0.1'),
    'port' => env('DB_PORT', '3306'),
    'database' => env('DB_DATABASE', 'forge'),
    'username' => env('DB_USERNAME', 'forge'),
    'password' => env('DB_PASSWORD', ''),
    ...
],
```

==Make sure the `'default'` is set to `mysql`, not hardcoded to `sqlite`.==

---

#### 4. **Restart Laravel server (optional but safe)**

If you're running with:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Stop it and restart to make sure all changes are reflected.

---

#### 5. **Check if `.env` file is loaded properly**

Sometimes, `.env` might not be loading correctly. To confirm, run this:

```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> config('database.default')
```

It should return:

```
mysql
```

If it returns `sqlite`, then `.env` isn't being read ‚Äî possibly due to file format, missing `.env` file, or permission issues.

---

Let me know what `config('database.default')` shows, or share the output of:

```bash
php artisan config:show database
```

I‚Äôll help you troubleshoot further if needed.


Problem :
==Illuminate\Database\QueryException==
==SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'doctordesk.sessions' doesn't exist (Connection: mysql, SQL: select * from `sessions` where `id` = qNDfmbGTeBNne8zykFPFGJ96vIHPEM85YwUIssAq limit 1)==


You're getting this error:

```
SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'doctordesk.sessions' doesn't exist
```

This means Laravel is **using MySQL successfully**, but it **can't find the `sessions` table** in your `doctordesk` database.

---

### ‚úÖ Why This Happens

Laravel uses a **`sessions` table** only if you're storing sessions in the **database** (as configured in `.env`).

If the table doesn't exist, Laravel throws this error when handling sessions.

---

### üîç Check: What‚Äôs in your `.env`?

You likely have:

```env
SESSION_DRIVER=database
```

This means Laravel expects a `sessions` table in your MySQL database.

---

### ‚úÖ Fix Options

#### ==**Option 1: Create the `sessions` table**==

==Run Laravel‚Äôs built-in command to create the `sessions` table:==

```bash
php artisan session:table
php artisan migrate
```

==This will:==

- ==Create a migration file for the `sessions` table.==
    
- ==Migrate it into your database.==
    

> ==‚úÖ This is the recommended fix if you want to use `database` session driver.==

---

#### **Option 2: Use `file` session driver (optional)**

If you don‚Äôt need database session storage, change your `.env`:

```env
SESSION_DRIVER=file
```

Then clear config cache:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan config:cache
```

Laravel will now store sessions in `storage/framework/sessions/`.

---

### üîÅ Summary

|Solution|Use When|
|---|---|
|`php artisan session:table && php artisan migrate`|You want to store sessions in the database (recommended for multi-server or secure environments).|
|`SESSION_DRIVER=file`|Simpler apps, local dev, or you don‚Äôt need DB sessions.|
